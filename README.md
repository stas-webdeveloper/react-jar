This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# This App is available on address  
https://stas-webdeveloper.github.io/react-jar/  

# What does it do?  
  - Step 1: Empty jar and 4 coins on the left. 3 small empty jars (place holders) on the right.â€¨Coin values: $0.25, $0.1, $0.05, $0.01  
  - Step 2: The user clicks the coin then drags it into a jar. 
Animation and how you will arrange coins inside the "jar" is up to you (user can drag 56 coins into the jar or just 4 coins)
After the new coin landed inside the "jar," the badge reflected the number of such coins inside.
After the first coin landed inside the jar, the link "clear" and the button "done" show up. Another way to do it is to have these 2 links visible from the beginning but have them disabled.  
- Step 3: Once users decide that "jar" contains the exact amount, they will click "done."  The big jar becomes empty again, and one of the placeholders on the right changes to the image of "closed jar"  
- Step 3.1: If users decide to change coins, click "clear," and "jar" gets to the default state (empty).  
- Step 3.2: When a user clicks on "double-check" they see what inside of this "jar"  
- Step 3.3: If you click "redo" in the modal window, the "closed jar" gets to the default state (empty).
